## 🤘 Why This Is Awesome

Ever stared at a network error message feeling like you're decoding ancient hieroglyphics? We've been there. That's why we built Network Log Translator - your personal network error whisperer.

```bash
# Before Network Translator
"DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET" 😕

# After Network Translator
"Yo! Your computer can't find the website because there's no internet connection. 
 Here's how to fix it..." 😎
```
